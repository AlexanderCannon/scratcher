              <Typography>
                Scratcher operates as a decentralized platform that enables
                content creators to monetize their articles by selling or
                licensing them to publishers, online platforms, and news
                organizations on the blockchain.

              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 1: Content Creation
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Content creators can write articles and upload them onto the
                platform. Each article is unique and can be categorized into
                different topics, such as technology, finance, or lifestyle.
                Creators can set a price for each article they upload and choose
                whether they want to offer it as a non-exclusive digital asset.
              </Typography>
              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 2: Asset Creation
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Once an article is uploaded, the platform creates a unique
                digital asset for that specific article on the blockchain. The
                asset contains information about the article, such as its title,
                author, and content. It also includes metadata that verifies the
                authenticity and ownership of the article.
              </Typography>
              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 3: Asset Listing
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                After an asset is created, content creators can list it on the
                marketplace for publishers, online platforms, and news
                organizations to discover and purchase. The asset is listed
                alongside other digital assets on the platform, and potential
                buyers can browse the marketplace to find articles they are
                interested in buying or licensing.
              </Typography>
              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 4: Asset Purchase or Licensing
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                When a buyer decides to purchase or license an article, they buy
                the associated digital asset on the blockchain. The platform
                facilitates the transaction using cryptocurrency, and the
                digital asset is transferred to the buyer's digital wallet. The
                content creator is always credited for the article and receives
                a percentage of the sale or licensing fee as a royalty for each
                transaction.
              </Typography>
              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 5: Article Access
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Once a buyer owns a digital asset, they can access the
                associated article on the platform. The article can be viewed
                and downloaded in different formats, such as raw text, markdown,
                or HTML. Buyers can also connect directly to their CMS or
                blogging platform, such as Substack, to seamlessly import the
                article into their platform.
              </Typography>
              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 6: Article Syndication
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Buyers can syndicate the article to their own platform or
                publication. The article can be republished or excerpted in
                accordance with the licensing agreement. The content creator
                receives a percentage of the licensing fee as a royalty for each
                syndication.
              </Typography>
              <Typography as="h2" variant="subheading">
                Step 7: Article Promotion
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Content creators can promote their articles on the platform
                through various means, such as advertising, social media, or
                collaboration with other creators. By promoting their articles,
                creators can increase their visibility and attract more
                potential buyers to purchase or license their digital assets.
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                The article distribution marketplace enables content creators to
                monetize their articles by selling or licensing them to
                publishers, online platforms, and news organizations on the
                blockchain. With the power of blockchain technology, the
                platform ensures that each article is unique, verifiable, and
                secure, providing a transparent and fair system for creators and
                buyers alike. Buyers can receive articles in different formats
                and connect directly to their CMS, allowing for seamless
                integration into their existing platform.
